<h2>My name is Kevinika Legier</h2>
<p>I was born and raised in New Orleans Louisiana. Naturally, I consider myself to be a jack of all creative trades. I'm a mother of 3 with 1 on the way, so balancing my
    hobbies with their needs is essential for the well-being of us all.

<h2>Mother of 3+1!</h2>

<p>There's nothing I enjoy more than being a mother! Being a full-time mom is a blessing to me. Each child has a different personality 
    and hobby; I try to acommodate them all! We have a rotutine that I try to stick to, because without a routine, things get messy!
    I like to think of myself as the executive of the household. I love to be organized, it makes my job so much easier and I get to have free time with my babies. 
    It's a win win in my book. Here's a look at our weekday schedule.
    </p>
  <h4>How I balance my life with the kids:</h4>

  <h2>I love to create!</h2>
  <h4>My hobby consists of:</h4>
<ul>
    <ul style="background-color:rgb(245, 246, 186);">
    <li>Painting</li>
    <li>Sketching</li>
    <li>Digitizing</li>
    <li>emroidering</li>
</ul>
<p>There's really no limit to what I can create. I paint for fun and
    also use my talent as a source of income. I began my journey painting through postpartem 5 years ago.
    Acrylic paintings and color pencil sketches were my first endevours. Once I realised how skillful I really was, through the eyes of others, I took it a step further and began painting on jackets. 
    From there peeked my interest in customizing shoes. When I realised those things took time to make a steady income,
    I invested in a professional embroidery machince with intent to transform my art into stitch patches.
    Learning the software required for digitizing was the most challenging thing I've taught myself. It was 
    totally out my creative legue and more in the tech category.
    Somehow my hard work paid off and I now know how to navigate the software with 
    ease and create whatever design I choose. It doesnt stop there! 
    Face painting also became a hobby of mine ; which was discovered through playtime with my kids.
    Once I post the results of that, people started messaging me to book for their personal events.
    Truthfully I'd prefer to facepaint my kids, they are a better canvas when it comes to keeping still.
    Lately I've been painting on bags and digitizing while I await my new baby.
